EVTNAME2651;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2651;According to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to another nation -- but only those lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2660;Our Lands Returned;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2660;As a result of the treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, some of $COUNTRY$'s lands are to be returned. We are, however, only entitled to those lands over which we have a claim. Any others should, by all rights, be returned to $FROMCOUNTRY$. \n\n§RNOTE: If you took $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ core provinces which are not also your own core provinces in this war, enacting the 'return' option will give those lands back. Be careful!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
